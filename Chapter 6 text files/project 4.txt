After this code is executed, the array happy_string will still contain the six
letters in the C-string "DoBeDo", but happy_string will no longer contain the
null character '\0' to mark the end of the C string. Many string-manipulating
functions depend critically on the presence of '\0' to mark the end of the
C-string value.
